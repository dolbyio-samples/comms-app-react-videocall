## Getting Started

The steps below will quickly get you started testing Dolby.io’s capabilities

### How to get a Dolby.io account

Dolby.io Comms API requires you to create a Dolby.io account.
To set it up, you need to go to <https://dashboard.dolby.io/signup/> and complete the form. After confirming your email address, you will be logged in.

### Dolby.io dashboard

After logging in, you get access to the full dashboard where you can manage your account.

From this page <https://dashboard.dolby.io/dashboard/applications/summary> you can manage your profile and billing.

### How to obtain access token

To run the application, you need to generate a special access token and paste it into the source code of the app. Go to the _Dashboard_, and find the _Launch Demos_ button. On the next screen, will be a token field where you can copy the client access token to your clipboard. The generated token is active for 12 hours.

## How to run the Video Conferencing app

Below is a list of steps necessary to run the application locally.

### Clone repository

Use git to clone the repository with
`git clone git@github.com:dolbyio-samples/comms-app-react-videoconference.git`
or simply download using the green button on the top of this page and unzip the repository

### Install dependencies

```

and if you are using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), type command

```bash
npm install
```

### Paste the token

      </ConferenceCreateProvider>
    </TranslationProvider>
  );
```
